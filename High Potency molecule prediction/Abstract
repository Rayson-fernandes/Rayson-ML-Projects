The integration of machine learning (ML) techniques into drug discovery has
significantly transformed the pharmaceutical research landscape. ML methods are now
widely used to accelerate various stages of drug development, including target
identification, compound screening, and lead optimization.The ability of ML algorithms
to analyze complex datasets, such as protein-ligand interactions, chemical structures,
and biological responses, has enabled more efficient and accurate predictions in drug
design. Applications range from virtual screening and de novo drug design to drug
repurposing and toxicity prediction. Emerging areas, such as deep learning and
graph-based models, have further enhanced the predictive capabilities of ML,
facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutics. Additionally, advancements in
computational power, such as GPU-accelerated computing, have supported the
implementation of large-scale ML models, enabling the integration of diverse datasets
for a more holistic approach to drug discovery. This abstract highlights the
revolutionary role of ML in modern pharmaceutical research, emphasizing its potential
to address critical challenges in the development of effective and safe therapies.
